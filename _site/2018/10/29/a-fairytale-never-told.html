      <p>Once upon a time there was a simple minded being. In fact, this being was so simple that it lacked any mental capacity to understand why other beings just… did things.</p>

<p>This very being would go into the woods 4 times a week, having the time of its life, utilizing it’s bodily functions to the max, inspecting all the different types of mushrooms, leaves, bushes and plants it could find, taking notes, applying its elaborate marking system to determine only those it deemed worthy of………..</p>

<p>later throwing them into a river?</p>

<p>And now you need to catch yourself. Why did it do that? Why repeat the same type of actions with only small time intervals inbetween? Why all the preperation, use of energy and creativity for it all to eventually go down the drain (not quite literally, but close enough).</p>

<p>Well, the answer is simple. Because it is fun.</p>

<p>Rather than being consumed by doubts each time it was about to embark on another mission. Wondering whether or not it would even find anything of interest this time around. Or especially on those particularly rainy and miserable days, being so frustrated with the task that it would want to quit.</p>

<p>It would focus only on how satisfying the process is, because it had payed attention to its own desires, minimized external tasks that didn’t match them and quickly recovered from setbacks by accepting them, embracing the challenges and using them as opportunities to evolve.</p>
