      <p>“thoughts justify feelings justify thoughts justify actions” Hm.</p>

<p>An example:
You’re someone with a fairly loose schedule, except that thursday evenings tend to be your /go out with Steve to an art gallery/ dates. You might presume that other friends of yours know about this as you’ve mentioned it occasionally and have cancelled on other thursday events because of it in the past.</p>

<p>Now it is the beginning of a new week, let’s say Tuesday. A friend group of yours has decided to go out for dinner on Thursday, which they agreed upon over the weekend. You weren’t involved and don’t know about this yet. You don’t find out about it until it comes up during a conversation with a friend who is part of said friend group.
Now you – as one does – begin to think.</p>

<p>What possible reasons could there be that they didn’t invite me to go out with them?
Surely they must not want me there. Otherwise they would have asked me, right?
Or maybe they don’t want to spend time with me anymore in general. Maybe they don’t want me to be a part of the group anymore. Maybe I did something to upset them. Maybe I’ve changed in ways they don’t like. Have I been ignoring anyones messages lately? What if I forgot someones birthday? Oh God, what if one of them is celebrating theirs on Thursday and I’m not invited because I forgot about it?</p>

<p>…..Really? The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Now it could be that you’re someone who is aware of these thought patterns. And you might try to come up with rational reasons that could lift you out of this cycle.
But what if those backfire, too?</p>

<p>What if “Maybe they didn’t ask me because they already know I have plans on thursday”
leads to “But maybe they knew I had plans with someone else and purposefully chose thursday, so I couldn’t come.” Or
“Maybe they wanted to go to a restaurant, that only serves dishes I don’t like.” leads to
“But maybe they purposefully chose a restaurant like that so that even if I find out about it and did have time, I can’t join.”</p>

<p>Now since we happen to be in an imaginary situation. We can easily stop.
Take a deep breath. And think about what the hell we’re doing.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that friends planned something without us, we got upset. We felt left out. This is a valid and human response. But we don’t genuinely acknowledge that. Instead we try to find a way to get rid of it as quickly as possible. To do that we want to find a reason for our misery, something we can point at and say “Hah, I’ve found you! You’re the reason I’m feeling bad even though I should be feeling fine!” hoping that this discovery magically drowns the emotion. But that’s just not how it works.</p>

<p>So maybe, instead of looking for the endless possible reasons and explanations for people’s actions, we could accept that the situation is as it is. People do what they do. And as said before, we’re still allowed to feel and react honestly. The option to communicate that authentically still remains.</p>

<p>“Oh you’re going out on thursday, that’s a shame I would like to have joined.”</p>
