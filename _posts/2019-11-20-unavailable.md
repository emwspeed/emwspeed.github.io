Of fortitude no word left,
unspoken, accepted in its place of depth
In the corner of your vision lays a lie
You ignore it.. still.. waiting.. patience.

A throbbing gut, a pulsating wire
Hooked up to a center you dare not even try to control
For if you do it gets worse and only as you clean up the mess it left behind you realize….
It’s already over, there’ll never be time to process it. Or so you say.

Same silhouette, same air, same walk, same place, the same?
Not quite. Never quite. And never. Ever exact.
But always it triggers, for only one day it might not.
You will be forgiven and you will have done what was necessary for it.

But what is necessary?
