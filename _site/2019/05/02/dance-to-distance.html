      <p>A fog, laying it’s fingers over your shoulder
lifting you up and away as you try to move closer
In your place taking a stand
telling you it’s all over</p>

<p>but it’s not.
Not enough.
not enough time.
not enough space.
not enough happy memories that you’ll leave in this place.
not enough treasured
not enough fought.
no.
too much.
too much buried
too much forgotten
too much taken out of context
and too much run to the rotten core of mind</p>

<p>paranoia.</p>

<p>a lightWave. (pleon)
no strings attached?
as if!
pulling you in?
you wish!
it’s doing it’s best, dragging you out
drugging the hell out of you until you cannot shout
but you’re thankful.
because this time
it’s not enough
it can’t go on forever
no trap
pull yourself together
most importantly.
make it your own
you’ll see once it’s a part of your reality
you’ll be yourself once again
you.</p>
