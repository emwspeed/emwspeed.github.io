An old teacher once said it's better to grow up learning only one language because apparently the lack of whatever other one you'd be able to communicate in would make up for how much better you'd be in your native language.

And I don't think he could've been more wrong so here's an analogy explaining why.

Let's say every person has a certain amount of resources available, which I shall refer to as "<span style="color:#008080;">blocks</span>". Over the course of your life you will take these <span style="color:#008080;">blocks</span> and place them in your "<span style="color:#800080;">skill fields</span>". In this example our <span style="color:#800080;">skill fields</span> are different <span style="color:#800080;">languages</span>, and on each skill field you can aquire "<span style="color:#ff6600;">points"</span> by placing more <span style="color:#008080;">blocks</span> on them.

Placing <span style="color:#008080;">one block</span> on a <span style="color:#800080;">skill field</span>, will grant you <span style="color:#ff6600;">50 points</span>. Those would be about equal to knowing the basics of a language ( = general everyday mostly fluid talk, but you couldn't be an author yet). Every additional <span style="color:#008080;">block on the same <span style="color:#800080;">skill field will grant you <span style="color:#ff6600;">only 10 more points</span>. 

So let's say you have <span style="color:#008080;">3 blocks</span> available for your <span style="color:#800080;">language skill fields</span>. You could place all your <span style="color:#008080;">blocks</span> on <span style="color:#800080;">English</span>, which would grant you <span style="color:#ff6600;">70 points</span>. <em>Or </em>you could place the 1st on English, 2nd on German, 3rd on.... Japanese. Therefore you get <span style="color:#ff6600;">50 points</span> per <span style="color:#800080;">skill field</span> which in total adds up to <span style="color:#ff6600;">150 points</span>, more than double the amount of what you get by placing them all on only one field!

<del>Also I like colours... sorry if they are overwhelming.</del>

<del>Started out this analogy with "... every person starts out in life with a certain limited amount of balls"</del>
