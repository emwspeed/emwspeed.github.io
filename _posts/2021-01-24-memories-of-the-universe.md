needles racing towards you as sharp as
doors opening up to an
ocean full of wonder engulfed in a stream of 
conciousness of the world of your own, of the 
father you never would have been, of the
child never allowed to roam, of the
coin and it's rightful place in the world and of

fluff appearing for no reason, of the
fingertips so magical and unique to no one but the imagination of the
creators so far you may only hope to 
dream but they are
here
